- main game loop (w/ alternating teams)
- engine (ml)
- ai (minimax + ab pruning to choose moves)
- add eval num/bar to display


bug: pawn controls diagonally, thinks pawn can block even if there is no piece there
- use legal moves instead of control?
- do i even need control anymore?
-> control and legal moves are not the same, need control for diag pawn + it's helpful

bug: when in check, can make move that doesn't free you from check
- could store and change those squares in board, see if still in check. if not, add to legal
- need to check if move frees you from check
	- make this change in legal moves, legal moves should only be a list of moves that ai can make
	- stale = no moves and no check
	- mate = no moves and check
